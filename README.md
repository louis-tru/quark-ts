Quark
===============

Quark is a cross-platform (Android/iOS) front-end development framework. The core code is written in C++. The bottom layer is based on OpenGL drawing. The upper layer implements a streamlined typesetting engine and a JS/JSX running environment. The goal is to develop GUI applications on this basis, which can take both development speed and operation efficiency into account.
